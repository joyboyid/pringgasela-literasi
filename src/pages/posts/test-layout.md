## What is it?

A simple template for building a fast, pre-generated HTML website using [Astro](https://astro.build/). With [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) baked-in, ready to deploy to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) in a couple of clicks.

Use it as a starter for your own JAMstack projects, or as an easy way to get started building websites with Astro.
