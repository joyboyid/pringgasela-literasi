**Debug code** is [computer code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_code "Computer code") introduced to a [computer program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program "Computer program") to test for errors or to help determine the cause of an error. It can be as simple as an [echo command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_(command) "Echo (command)") to print the value of a variable at certain points of a program. Modern [integrated development environments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment "Integrated development environment") sometimes render this unnecessary by allowing the placement of stop points at specific places in the program, and providing the ability to view the value of variables through the IDE rather than program output.

## Uses of debug code[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Debug_code&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Uses of debug code")]

Debug code's main function is to help [debug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugging "Debugging") code. This can do this in several ways, such as using print statements, assert commands and unit testing.

### Use in coding[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Debug_code&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Use in coding")]

Small statements can be added to code in order to find the presence and the location of bugs within a program. It can also be used to provide test inputs to simulate possible use cases that a program might need to be able to accept. It can also be used as a place holder for code that is still in development.

### Use in video games[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Debug_code&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Use in video games")]

Many video gaming mod, [cheat codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheat_code "Cheat code"), such as [level cheat code](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Level_select_(video_gaming)&action=edit&redlink=1 "Level select (video gaming) (page does not exist)"), [invincibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_video_game_terms#God_mode "Glossary of video game terms"), etc. were originally introduced as debug code to allow the programmers and/or testers to skip hindrances that would prevent them from rapidly getting to parts of the game that needed to be tested; and in these cases [cheat modes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheat_mode "Cheat mode") are often referred to as [debugging mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Debugging_mode&action=edit&redlink=1 "Debugging mode (page does not exist)").

It is recommended as a [best practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_practice "Best practice") that debugging code be removed from production versions of applications, as it can slow them down.[\[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debug_code#cite_note-1) However some games leave these commands and cheats available for the players to use as a way to enhance their play experience. For example, the PC version of [The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elder_Scrolls_V:_Skyrim "The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim") allows the player access to the command console, giving them the ability to modify certain aspects of their game as it is being run. These commands include giving the player invincibility, teleportation and unlimited gold.[\[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debug_code#cite_note-2)
